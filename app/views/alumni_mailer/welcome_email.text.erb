Hi <%=@alumni.first_name%>, Welcome To UTC Kyema Alumni Association!

On behalf of the nearly 1,000+ alumni of this great institution, it is my pleasure to welcome you to the Uganda Technical College-Kyema Alumni Association. The association exists, wholly and solely, to help our alumni and, by extension, the College itself, succeed.

The world gets more complicated with every passing day. We get involved with our families and work and suddenly we’ve lost touch with those outside that close circle. The Alumni Association can help you stay connected to those friends and to the vast resources available here, from the faculty that taught and guided you to our libraries, seminars, and web sites, social media and an extraordinary variety of “stay connected” programs designed with you in mind. They are all designed to support you as you pursue your post-academic life and career.

Now more than ever, it’s important for people to feel connected. One opportunity for Kyema alumni to connect—and network—online is the official Facebook page, Instagram, twitter account and professional network whatsup groups. Through these social media platforms, we want to help Kyema’s Alumni make connections with fellow alumni and join in discussions about careers and networking. Discussion posts are moderated and are topics of general interest to alumni including career-related news stories, alumni networking opportunities, and career advice. Whether you’re career building, job hunting, or just looking to reach out, here are three tips to help you make the most of this resource and your fellow alumni:

a)      Start a Discussion: Looking to find other alumni in your profession on the what sup platforms? Need advice on a job search? Wondering how others have navigated career shifts? Ask! Members of the group can post relevant discussions and questions for alumni to comment on, and comment on other group members’ posts.

b)      Post a Job: With the breadth of diversity and talent in the alumni community, chances are a fellow alumnus/a might be the perfect candidate (or know someone who would be). Alumni are welcome to post job openings in the group from their company’s or networks that may be of interest to other alumni.

c)       Reach Out: We are working on our LinkedIn’s latest update to groups, were members will be able to easily message anyone in the group and have the flexibility to control which messages they accept or privately decline. Members will receive a notification about their message requests just like they would with a regular message and continue the conversation with a single click of "accept."
 

And be sure to also check out these other platforms to help you more effectively engage with the group on social media:
